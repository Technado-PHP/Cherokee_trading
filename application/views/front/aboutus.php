						<!--<p>-->
						<!--	As a young man growing up in Texas, one of my favorite past times was reading about the Old West. My-->
						<!--	dad had subscriptions to True West, Frontier Times, and Old West magazines. I had plenty of reading-->
						<!--	material. I studied two things; treasure buried by Outlaws, and the Sheriffs and Marshalls who tracked-->
						<!--	them down. Well, I've long since given up on finding buried treasure (most of it is now covered by-->
						<!--	buildings, highways, and parking lots), but my fascination with the "tough guys" of the Old West-->
						<!--	continues. -->
						<!--</p>-->
						<!--<p>-->
						<!--	As a child I had the whole outfit--Cowboy hat, holster, pistol and cap gun, and either an Old West Sheriff or Marshall badge. I was quite the sight to see. One week I'd wear a Tombstone Marshall Badge and pretend to be Wyatt Earp. The next week I might be Lincoln County Sheriff Pat Garret, chasing down Billy the Kid and the "Regulators". Over the years I wore out more boots and traveled more miles hunting bad guys than you'd ever see on TV-->
